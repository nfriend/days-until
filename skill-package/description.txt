Days Until helps you keep track of the number of days until special events. Set up a countdown with any of these:

- "Alexa, open Days Until"
- "Alexa, ask Days Until to start a new countdown"
- "Alexa, ask Days Until to create a countdown for the first day of school"
- "Alexa, ask Days Until to create a new countdown for the first day of school on August 21"

Alexa will then confirm the date with you before the countdown is saved.

After you've created a countdown, you can ask Alexa how many days there are until the event:

- "Alexa, ask Days Until, 'How many days until the first day of school?'"
- "Alexa, ask Days Until, 'How long until the first day of school?'"

Alexa will then calculate the number of days from today until the event's date and report back to you. If you have a video-enabled Echo device, Alexa will also show the result on the screen.

If you're having trouble getting Alexa to recognize your event name, try something a bit simpler. For example, instead of "John Smith's retirement party at the lakehouse", try "the retirement party", or even just "the party".
