Days Until helps you keep track of the number of days until special events.

You: "Alexa, ask Days Until to create a new countdown for the birthday party on June 5th."
Alexa: "Okay, I'll start a new countdown for the birthday party on June 5th. Does that sound right?"
You: "Yes!"

... later that day ...

You: "Alexa, ask Days Until, how long until the birthday party?"
Alexa: "12 days."

Other examples of things you can do:

You: "Alexa, ask Days Until to list all my countdowns."
Alexa: "You have 3 countdowns. The birthday party is in 12 days. Christmas is in 25 days. Disney World is in 192 days."

You: "Alexa, ask Days Until to set up daily reminders for Disney World."
Alexa: "Okay, what time of day would you like to be reminded?"
You: "3 PM."
Alexa: "You're all set. I'll send you daily reminders during the 10 days before Disney World."


CREATING A NEW COUNTDOWN

Set up a countdown with any of these phrases:

- "Alexa, open Days Until."
- "Alexa, ask Days Until to start a new countdown."
- "Alexa, ask Days Until to create a countdown for the first day of school."
- "Alexa, ask Days Until to create a new countdown for the first day of school on August 21st."
- "Alexa, tell Days Until to begin a new one on the 21st of August for the first day of school."

Alexa will then confirm the event name and date before the countdown is saved.


CHECKING A COUNTDOWN

After you've created a countdown, you can ask Alexa how many days there are until the event:

- "Alexa, ask Days Until, 'How many days until the first day of school?'"
- "Alexa, ask Days Until, 'How long until the first day of school?'"
- "Alexa, open Days Until and tell me how much time there is until the first day of school."

Alexa will then calculate the number of days from today until the event's date and report back to you. If you have a video-enabled Alexa device, Alexa will also show the result on the screen.


CHECKING ALL COUNTDOWNS

You can get a complete list of all your countdowns by asking:

- "Alexa, ask Days Until to list all my countdowns."

Video-enabled devices will show all countdowns on the screen.


SETTING UP DAILY COUNTDOWN REMINDERS

After creating a countdown, Alexa will prompt you to create daily reminders during the 10 days leading up to the event.

You can also set up these reminders manually by saying:

- "Alexa, ask Days Until to create daily reminders."
- "Alexa, ask Days Until to set up reminders for my birthday."


CORRECTING A COUNTDOWN

If you create a countdown with the wrong date, simply recreate the event with the same name. The old countdown will be automatically replaced with the new countdown.


DELETING A COUNTDOWN

If you no longer want a countdown, just ask Alexa to delete it:

- "Alexa, ask Days Until to delete a countdown."
- "Alexa, ask Days Until to erase my birthday."

Deleting a countdown will also delete any reminders for the event that were created by Days Until.


TIPS AND TRICKS

If you're having trouble getting Alexa to recognize your event name, try something a bit simpler. For example, instead of "John Smith's retirement party at the lakehouse", try "the retirement party", or even just "the party".

In some cases, you may be able to leave out the skill name and just say:

- "Alexa, how long until the first day of school?"

Days Until also works great on video-enabled Alexa devices. Give it a try on your Echo Show or through your Amazon Fire TV Stick!
