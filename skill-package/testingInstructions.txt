This update fixes a small edge case bug.

Previously, this skill didn't handle AMAZON.YesIntent or AMAZON.NoIntent if it wasn't expecting a question:

User: Alexa, open Days Until
Alexa: Hello! Would you like to create a new countdown or check an existing one?
User: Yes
Alexa: You just triggered AMAZON.YesIntent, but no handler was able to handle the request.

Now, these kind of situations redirect back to the skill's FallbackIntent handler:

User: Alexa, open Days Until
Alexa: Hello! Would you like to create a new countdown or check an existing one?
User: Yes
Alexa: Shoot! Sorry, but Days Until doesn't know how to do that! You can create, check, and delete countdowns, and also set countdown reminders. What would you like to do?
