This is a small bug fix update. Two bugs are fixed:

1. User timezone is taken into account when computing the number of days until an event. Previously, the calculation was occasionally off by one day, depending on the time of day in the user's local time zone.
2. Previously, when Alexa prompted the user to create a second countdown, Alexa would not recognize the event name of the second countdown (it refused to fill the slot). Now users can successfully create several countdowns in succession.
