This update fixes one small bug.

Currently, when a user attempts to set up daily reminders for a non-existent countdown, Alexa runs into an error ("Shoot! Something went wrong. Can you try again?").

Now this case is handled, and Alexa responds with a more informative response ("Shoot! I don't see a countdown for My Birthday").
