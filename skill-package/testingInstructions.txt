The only change in this update is the skill logo.

The skill logo is rendering strangely on Amazon.com (see https://www.amazon.com/Nathan-Friend-Consulting-LLC-Until/dp/B0759KJ8D2). I've removed the transparency from the original logos and replaced it with a white background:

I am hoping this fixes the problem! The images look okay in the Alexa Developer Console.
