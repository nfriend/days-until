The old countdown will be automatically replaced with the new countdown.\n\nDELETING A COUNTDOWN\n--------------------\n\nIf you no longer want a countdown, just ask Alexa to delete it:\n\n- \"Alexa, ask Days Until to delete a countdown.\"\n- \"Alexa, ask Days Until to erase my birthday.\"\n\nDeleting a countdown will also delete any reminders for the event that were created by Days Until.\n\nTIPS AND TRICKS\n---------------\n\nIf you're having trouble getting Alexa to recognize your event name, try something a bit simpler. For example, instead of \"John Smith's retirement party at the lakehouse\", try \"the retirement party\", or even just \"the party\".\n\nIn some cases, you may be able to leave out the skill name and just say:\n\n- \"Alexa, how long until the first day of school?\"\n\nDays Until also works great on video-enabled Alexa devices. Give it a try on your Echo Show or through your Amazon Fire TV Stick!\n\nATTRIBUTIONS\n------------\n\nIcons from www.flaticon.com were made by the following authors:\n\n- Freepik (https://www.flaticon.com/authors/freepik)\n- Eucalyp (https://www.flaticon.com/authors/eucalyp)\n- mangsaabguru (https://www.flaticon.com/authors/mangsaabguru)\n- Good Ware (https://www.flaticon.com/authors/good-ware)\n",

Does that sound right?\"\nYou: \"Yes!\"\n\n... later that day ...\n\nYou: \"Alexa, ask Days Until, how long until the birthday party?\"\nAlexa: \"12 days.\"\n\nOther examples of things you can do:\n\nYou: \"Alexa, ask Days Until to list all my countdowns.\"\nAlexa: \"You have 3 countdowns. The birthday party is in 12 days. Christmas is in 25 days. Disney World is in 192 days.\"\n\nYou: \"Alexa, ask Days Until to set up daily reminders for Disney World.\"\nAlexa: \"Okay, what time of day would you like to be reminded?\"\nYou: \"3 PM.\"\nAlexa: \"You're all set. I'll send you daily reminders during the 10 days before Disney World.\"\n\nCREATING A NEW COUNTDOWN\n------------------------\n\nSet up a countdown with any of these phrases:\n\n- \"Alexa, open Days Until.\"\n- \"Alexa, ask Days Until to start a new countdown.\"\n- \"Alexa, ask Days Until to create a countdown for the first day of school.\"\n- \"Alexa, ask Days Until to create a new countdown for the first day of school on August 21st.\"\n- \"Alexa, tell Days Until to begin a new one on the 21st of August for the first day of school.\"\n\nAlexa will then confirm the event name and date before the countdown is saved.\n\nCHECKING A COUNTDOWN\n--------------------\n\nAfter you've created a countdown, you can ask Alexa how many days there are until the event:\n\n- \"Alexa, ask Days Until, 'How many days until the first day of school?'\"\n- \"Alexa, ask Days Until, 'How long until the first day of school?'\"\n- \"Alexa, open Days Until and tell me how much time there is until the first day of school.\"\n\nAlexa will then calculate the number of days from today until the event's date and report back to you. If you have a video-enabled Alexa device, Alexa will also show the result on the screen.\n\nCHECKING ALL COUNTDOWNS\n-----------------------\n\nYou can get a complete list of all your countdowns by asking:\n\n- \"Alexa, ask Days Until to list all my countdowns.\"\n\nVideo-enabled devices will show all countdowns on the screen.\n\nSETTING UP DAILY COUNTDOWN REMINDERS\n------------------------------------\n\nAfter creating a countdown, Alexa will prompt you to create daily reminders during the 10 days leading up to the event.\n\nYou can also set up these reminders manually by saying:\n\n- \"Alexa, ask Days Until to create daily reminders.\"\n- \"Alexa, ask Days Until to set up reminders for my birthday.\"\n\nCORRECTING A COUNTDOWN\n----------------------\n\nIf you create a countdown with the wrong date, simply recreate the event with the same name. The old countdown will be automatically replaced with the new countdown.\n\nDELETING A COUNTDOWN\n--------------------\n\nIf you no longer want a countdown, just ask Alexa to delete it:\n\n- \"Alexa, ask Days Until to delete a countdown.\"\n- \"Alexa, ask Days Until to erase my birthday.\"\n\nDeleting a countdown will also delete any reminders for the event that were created by Days Until.\n\nTIPS AND TRICKS\n---------------\n\nIf you're having trouble getting Alexa to recognize your event name, try something a bit simpler. For example, instead of \"John Smith's retirement party at the lakehouse\", try \"the retirement party\", or even just \"the party\".\n\nIn some cases, you may be able to leave out the skill name and just say:\n\n- \"Alexa, how long until the first day of school?\"\n\nDays Until also works great on video-enabled Alexa devices.

      "testingInstructions": "LAUNCH DAYS UNTIL\n-----------------\n\n- \"Alexa, open Days Until.\"\n\nAlexa greets the user.\n\nThe first time they have launched the skill, Alexa gives a brief explanation of how to use the skill.\n\nOn subsequent launches, Alexa asks if they would like to create a new countdown or check an existing countdown.\n\nOn video-enabled devices (except for small devices like the Spot), two buttons are shown on the screen allowing a user to either create a new countdown or check an existing countdown.\n\nCREATE A COUNTDOWN\n------------------\n\n- \"Alexa, ask Days Until to create a new countdown.\"\n- \"Alexa, ask Days Until to start a new one for my birthday.\"\n- \"Alexa, ask Days Until to begin a new one for my birthday on June 5th.\"\n\nAlexa prompts to fill all slots (event name and event date), confirms that the countdown is correct, and creates the countdown (with celebratory sound effects).\n\nIf the user has not asked to opt out of reminder prompts, Alexa will prompt the use to create daily reminders for the event. If the user says no, Alexa will ask if they would like to opt out of reminder prompts permanently.\n\nIf the user has previously opted out of reminder prompts, they will instead be prompted to create another countdown.\n\nCHECK A COUNTDOWN\n-----------------\n\n- \"Alexa, ask Days Until to check an existing countdown.\"\n- \"Alexa, ask Days Until, 'how long until my birthday?'\"\n\nAlexa will respond with the number of days until the event over top of fun sound effects.\n\nSHOW ALL COUNTDOWNS\n-------------------\n\n- \"Alexa, ask Days Until to list all my countdowns.\"\n\nAlexa will read the total number of countdowns and list each with its current day count.\n\nVideo-enabled devices will see all countdowns rendered on the screen.\n\nDELETE COUNTDOWN\n----------------\n\n- \"Alexa, ask Days Until to delete a countdown.\"\n- \"Alexa, ask Days Until to erase my Birthday.\"\n\nAlexa asks to confirm, and then deletes the countdown (and any associated reminders, if applicable).\n\nCREATE REMINDERS\n----------------\n\nUsers are prompted to create reminders after creating a countdown unless they have previously opted out.\n\nReminders can also be created manually:\n\n- \"Alexa, ask Days Until to create daily reminders.\"\n- \"Alexa, ask Days Until to set up reminders for my birthday.\"\n\nAlexa asks what time of day the user would like the reminders, and then creates reminders for the 10 days leading up to the event (including the day of the event itself).\n\nReminders can be deleted by deleting the associated event.\n\nCreating a reminder undoes the reminder prompt opt-out mentioned above.\n\nMISCELLANEOUS\n-------------\n\nThis skill implements `CanFulfillIntentRequest`, so in some cases the skill name can be omitted:\n\n- \"Alexa, how many days until my retirement party?\"\n\nHowever, this often clashes with a default Alexa response so it rarely works.\n",
