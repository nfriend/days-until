I'll send you daily reminders during the 10 days before Disney World.\"\n\n\nCREATING A NEW COUNTDOWN\n\nSet up a countdown with any of these phrases:\n\n- \"Alexa, open Days Until.\"\n- \"Alexa, ask Days Until to start a new countdown.\"\n- \"Alexa, ask Days Until to create a countdown for the first day of school.\"\n- \"Alexa, ask Days Until to create a new countdown for the first day of school on August 21st.\"\n- \"Alexa, tell Days Until to begin a new one on the 21st of August for the first day of school.\"\n\nAlexa will then confirm the event name and date before the countdown is saved.\n\n\nCHECKING A COUNTDOWN\n\nAfter you've created a countdown, you can ask Alexa how many days there are until the event:\n\n- \"Alexa, ask Days Until, 'How many days until the first day of school?'\"\n- \"Alexa, ask Days Until, 'How long until the first day of school?'\"\n- \"Alexa, open Days Until and tell me how much time there is until the first day of school.\"\n\nAlexa will then calculate the number of days from today until the event's date and report back to you. If you have a video-enabled Alexa device, Alexa will also show the result on the screen.\n\n\nCHECKING ALL COUNTDOWNS\n\nYou can get a complete list of all your countdowns by asking:\n\n- \"Alexa, ask Days Until to list all my countdowns.\"\n\nVideo-enabled devices will show all countdowns on the screen.\n\n\nSETTING UP DAILY COUNTDOWN REMINDERS\n\nAfter creating a countdown, Alexa will prompt you to create daily reminders during the 10 days leading up to the event.\n\nYou can also set up these reminders manually by saying:\n\n- \"Alexa, ask Days Until to create daily reminders.\"\n- \"Alexa, ask Days Until to set up reminders for my birthday.\"\n\n\nCORRECTING A COUNTDOWN\n\nIf you create a countdown with the wrong date, simply recreate the event with the same name. The old countdown will be automatically replaced with the new countdown.\n\n\nDELETING A COUNTDOWN\n\nIf you no longer want a countdown, just ask Alexa to delete it:\n\n- \"Alexa, ask Days Until to delete a countdown.\"\n- \"Alexa, ask Days Until to erase my birthday.\"\n\nDeleting a countdown will also delete any reminders for the event that were created by Days Until.\n\n\nTIPS AND TRICKS\n\nIf you're having trouble getting Alexa to recognize your event name, try something a bit simpler. For example, instead of \"John Smith's retirement party at the lakehouse\", try \"the retirement party\", or even just \"the party\".\n\nIn some cases, you may be able to leave out the skill name and just say:\n\n- \"Alexa, how long until the first day of school?\"\n\nDays Until also works great on video-enabled Alexa devices.

If you have a video-enabled Alexa device, Alexa will also show the result on the screen.\n\n\nCHECKING ALL COUNTDOWNS\n\nYou can get a complete list of all your countdowns by asking:\n\n- \"Alexa, ask Days Until to list all my countdowns.\"\n\nVideo-enabled devices will show all countdowns on the screen.\n\n\nSETTING UP DAILY COUNTDOWN REMINDERS\n\nAfter creating a countdown, Alexa will prompt you to create daily reminders during the 10 days leading up to the event.\n\nYou can also set up these reminders manually by saying:\n\n- \"Alexa, ask Days Until to create daily reminders.\"\n- \"Alexa, ask Days Until to set up reminders for my birthday.\"\n\n\nCORRECTING A COUNTDOWN\n\nIf you create a countdown with the wrong date, simply recreate the event with the same name. The old countdown will be automatically replaced with the new countdown.\n\n\nDELETING A COUNTDOWN\n\nIf you no longer want a countdown, just ask Alexa to delete it:\n\n- \"Alexa, ask Days Until to delete a countdown.\"\n- \"Alexa, ask Days Until to erase my birthday.\"\n\nDeleting a countdown will also delete any reminders for the event that were created by Days Until.\n\n\nTIPS AND TRICKS\n\nIf you're having trouble getting Alexa to recognize your event name, try something a bit simpler. For example, instead of \"John Smith's retirement party at the lakehouse\", try \"the retirement party\", or even just \"the party\".\n\nIn some cases, you may be able to leave out the skill name and just say:\n\n- \"Alexa, how long until the first day of school?\"\n\nDays Until also works great on video-enabled Alexa devices. Give it a try on your Echo Show or through your Amazon Fire TV Stick!\n\n\nATTRIBUTIONS\n\nIcons from www.flaticon.com were made by the following authors:\n\n- Freepik (https://www.flaticon.com/authors/freepik)\n- Eucalyp (https://www.flaticon.com/authors/eucalyp)\n- mangsaabguru (https://www.flaticon.com/authors/mangsaabguru)\n- Good Ware (https://www.flaticon.com/authors/good-ware)\n\n\nSOURCE CODE\n\nDays Until's source code is hosted on GitLab.com: https://gitlab.com/nfriend/days-until\n",

Does that sound right?\"\nYou: \"Yes!\"\n\n... later that day ...\n\nYou: \"Alexa, ask Days Until, how long until the birthday party?\"\nAlexa: \"12 days.\"\n\nOther examples of things you can do:\n\nYou: \"Alexa, ask Days Until to list all my countdowns.\"\nAlexa: \"You have 3 countdowns. The birthday party is in 12 days. Christmas is in 25 days.

      "testingInstructions": "This is a small bug fix update. Two bugs are fixed:\n\n1. User timezone is taken into account when computing the number of days until an event. Previously, the calculation was occasionally off by one day, depending on the time of day in the user's local time zone.\n2. Previously, when Alexa prompted the user to create a second countdown, Alexa would not recognize the event name of the second countdown (it refused to fill the slot). Now users can successfully create several countdowns in succession.\n",
